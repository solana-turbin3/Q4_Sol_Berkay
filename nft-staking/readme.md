### NFT Staking Program

Use case: when you lock an nft for a period of time, you can earn some rewards or some other benefits like voting power or etc. (utility).

There are two types of nft staking 
1- custodial : user directly deposit the nft to the vault like on the escrow
2- non-custodial: user don't deposit the nft to the vault, instead the nft is freezed on the user's wallet and the stake account is created by the program. User approve to delegate the nft and then, user_account can be used while freezing the nft
